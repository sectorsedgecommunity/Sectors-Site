        <h3>DOWNLOAD THE GAME</h3>
        <p class="p-no-margin">The Steam version of the game is outdated and delisted, instead you can find updated versions of the game on GitHub.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">To download the latest version, click the button below and <code>click on seclient_win_<code>version</code>.zip</code> under "Assets".</p>
        <button class="button-style-base" onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/sectorsedge/sectorsedge/releases'"><img draggable=false src="win11.png" style="width:11.1px;margin:0"> Versions</button>
        <br/><br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">Unzip the files to a folder of your choice and run <code>sectorsedge.exe</code>. Don't worry about overwriting game files you've previously downloaded - all your settings and user data is saved in <code>%appdata%\vercidium</code>.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>PLAYING ON LINUX</h3>
        <p class="p-no-margin"><b>Cap the frame rate at 59 FPS to eliminate input lag.</b></p>
        <p class="p-no-margin">The game does not always work out-of-the-box with Proton. It may be playable with:
            <details><summary>Wine</summary><p>Simply run wine sectorsedge.exe. The game has been tested to work with Wine-8.21 or greater on some systems. See here for USE flags used by the community when successfully testing.</p></details>
            <details><summary>Proton 9</summary><p>with GameMode</p></details>
        <br/>
        <h3>FINDING PLAYERS</h3>
        <p class="p-no-margin">The best way to find players is on the community Discord server. Once you join, you can join any of the up-to-date servers listed in ⁠<code>#server-list</code>. Head over to <code>#⁠looking-for-game</code> and ping the <code>@Looking for Game</code> role to call others on to play! Mention the server you're on so they can quickly join.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">To avoid needing to copy-paste an IP each time (and to see live player counts from certain servers), you can add our community server list back into the game. Full details on how to do that are in <code>#server-list</code></p>
        <br/>
        <p class="p-no-margin">We usually hop on every Saturday - check the Events menu at the top of the channel list for more details. Assign yourself the <code>@Event Pings</code> role in ⁠Channels & Roles to be notified when this happens!</p>
